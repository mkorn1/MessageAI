# Product Context: MessageAI

## Why This Project Exists

### The Problem
Busy parents and caregivers struggle with:
- **Unreliable messaging** in areas with poor connectivity (school pickup zones, indoor playgrounds)
- **Lost context** when offline - can't reference important information like pickup times or medication doses
- **Uncertainty** about message delivery - "Did you see my message?" follow-ups
- **Coordination complexity** managing multiple schedules across family members, schools, and activities

### The Solution
A messaging app that prioritizes reliability and offline functionality, built specifically for the coordination needs of busy families.

## Core User Experience Goals

### Primary User Journey: Sarah (Busy Parent)
1. **Quick Updates**: Send instant messages to partner/family while on the go
2. **Reliable Delivery**: Trust that messages will send even with spotty connection
3. **Offline Access**: Reference message history without internet (pickup times, schedules)
4. **Delivery Confirmation**: Know when messages are received and read
5. **Group Coordination**: Manage family, school, and activity communications in one place
6. **Media Sharing**: Quickly share photos (kids' drawings, permission slips, outfit choices)

### Secondary User Journey: Mike (Partner/Family Member)
1. **Real-Time Response**: Reply immediately to keep Sarah informed
2. **Group Visibility**: Stay in loop with school/caregiver communications
3. **Status Sharing**: Show availability for coordination

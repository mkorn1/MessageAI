# iOS Device Testing Guide - Notification Permissions Modal Flow

## 🎯 **Testing Objective**
Verify that the notification permissions modal flow works correctly on a physical iOS device via Expo Go, including:
- Modal appearance and dismissal
- Permission request handling
- Foreground handler initialization
- Service state management

## 📱 **Prerequisites**
- Physical iOS device (iPhone/iPad)
- Expo Go app installed
- Development server running
- Device connected to same network as development machine

## 🧪 **Test Scenarios**

### **Scenario 1: First-Time User (No Permissions)**
1. **Clear App Data**: Delete and reinstall Expo Go app
2. **Launch App**: Open MessageAI in Expo Go
3. **Expected Behavior**:
   - App loads successfully
   - Permission modal appears after basic initialization
   - Modal shows proper UI with "Skip" and "Enable Notifications" buttons
   - Console shows: `🔔 NotificationService: Basic initialization complete`

### **Scenario 2: Permission Grant Flow**
1. **From Scenario 1**: Tap "Enable Notifications"
2. **Expected Behavior**:
   - Native iOS permission dialog appears
   - User taps "Allow"
   - Modal dismisses automatically
   - Console shows:
     ```
     🔔 NotificationService: Requesting notification permissions
     🔔 NotificationService: Permission status: granted
     🔔 NotificationService: Permissions granted, initializing foreground handling
     🔔 NotificationService: Setting up with permissions...
     🔔 NotificationService: Permission-based setup complete
     ```

### **Scenario 3: Permission Denial Flow**
1. **From Scenario 1**: Tap "Enable Notifications"
2. **Expected Behavior**:
   - Native iOS permission dialog appears
   - User taps "Don't Allow"
   - Modal dismisses with alert message
   - Console shows:
     ```
     🔔 NotificationService: Requesting notification permissions
     🔔 NotificationService: Permission status: denied
     ```

### **Scenario 4: Skip Permissions Flow**
1. **From Scenario 1**: Tap "Skip"
2. **Expected Behavior**:
   - Modal dismisses immediately
   - No permission request made
   - Console shows: `🔔 User skipped notification permissions`

### **Scenario 5: Already Granted Permissions**
1. **From Scenario 2**: Close and reopen app
2. **Expected Behavior**:
   - App loads without showing permission modal
   - Foreground handler initialized automatically
   - Console shows:
     ```
     🔔 useNotificationPermissions: Permissions already granted, initializing foreground handling
     🔔 NotificationService: Setting up with permissions...
     ```

## 🔍 **Verification Steps**

### **1. Console Log Verification**
Check that the following logs appear in the correct sequence:

#### **Basic Initialization**
```
🔔 NotificationService: Initializing...
🔔 NotificationService: Basic initialization complete
```

#### **Permission Modal Trigger**
```
🔔 useNotificationPermissions: Permission status changed: false
```

#### **Permission Grant**
```
🔔 NotificationService: Requesting notification permissions
🔔 NotificationService: Permission status: granted
🔔 NotificationService: Permissions granted, initializing foreground handling
🔔 NotificationService: Setting up with permissions...
🔔 NotificationService: Permission-based setup complete
```

#### **Already Granted**
```
🔔 useNotificationPermissions: Permissions already granted, initializing foreground handling
🔔 NotificationService: Setting up with permissions...
```

### **2. UI Behavior Verification**
- [ ] Permission modal appears at correct time
- [ ] Modal UI is properly styled and responsive
- [ ] Buttons work correctly (Skip, Enable Notifications)
- [ ] Modal dismisses appropriately
- [ ] Alert messages show for denial/skip scenarios
- [ ] No modal appears on subsequent launches (if permissions granted)

### **3. Service State Verification**
- [ ] `notificationService.isServiceInitialized()` returns `true`
- [ ] `notificationService.areNotificationsEnabled()` returns correct value
- [ ] Foreground handler is properly configured
- [ ] FCM token is obtained (on physical device only)

### **4. Error Handling Verification**
- [ ] App doesn't crash on permission denial
- [ ] App doesn't crash on skip
- [ ] Service continues to work without permissions
- [ ] Error messages are user-friendly

## 🐛 **Common Issues & Solutions**

### **Issue: Modal Doesn't Appear**
**Possible Causes**:
- Service not properly initialized
- Permission check failing
- Modal state not updating

**Debug Steps**:
1. Check console for initialization logs
2. Verify `notificationService.isServiceInitialized()` returns `true`
3. Check `useNotificationPermissions` hook state

### **Issue: Permission Request Fails**
**Possible Causes**:
- iOS permission dialog not appearing
- Permission status not updating
- Service state not syncing

**Debug Steps**:
1. Check iOS Settings > Privacy & Security > Notifications
2. Verify Expo Go has notification permissions
3. Check console for permission status logs

### **Issue: Foreground Handler Not Initialized**
**Possible Causes**:
- `initializeWithPermissions()` not called
- Permission status not detected correctly
- Service state inconsistency

**Debug Steps**:
1. Check console for permission setup logs
2. Verify permission status is correctly detected
3. Test notification functionality

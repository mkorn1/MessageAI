# PRD: Minimum Viable Message (Milestone 1.1)

## Introduction/Overview

This feature establishes the foundational messaging capability for MessageAI, enabling users to send and receive text messages in real-time. The goal is to create a basic but functional messaging system where messages sent from one device appear on both the sender's and receiver's screens within one second.

**Problem Solved:** Users need a reliable way to send text messages that appear instantly on both devices, establishing the core communication foundation for the MessageAI platform.

**Goal:** Enable real-time text messaging between authenticated users with immediate visual feedback on both sender and receiver devices.

## Goals

1. **Establish Basic Messaging Foundation:** Create the core messaging infrastructure using Firebase Firestore
2. **Enable Real-Time Communication:** Messages appear on both sender and receiver screens within 1 second
3. **Implement User Authentication:** Users must be authenticated to send/receive messages
4. **Create Clean UI:** Simple, familiar chat interface using modern styling (Tailwind CSS)
5. **Ensure Reliability:** Handle Firebase unavailability with clear error messaging

## User Stories

### Primary User: Busy Parent (Sarah)
**As a busy parent, I want to:**
- Send a text message to my partner and see it appear immediately on my screen
- Receive messages from my partner and see them appear instantly on my screen
- Know that my message was successfully sent when I see it in the chat
- Trust that the messaging system works reliably

### Secondary User: Partner (Mike)
**As Sarah's partner, I want to:**
- Receive messages from Sarah and see them appear on my screen immediately
- Send messages back to Sarah and see them appear on my screen
- Have confidence that our communication is working properly

## Functional Requirements

### Authentication & User Management
1. The system must require user authentication before allowing message sending/receiving
2. The system must display the authenticated user's information in the chat interface
3. The system must support multiple authenticated users simultaneously

### Message Sending
4. The system must provide a text input field for composing messages
5. The system must provide a send button to submit messages
6. The system must immediately display sent messages on the sender's screen
7. The system must save messages to Firebase Firestore `messages` collection
8. The system must include message data: `{ id, text, senderId, timestamp, chatId }`

### Message Receiving
9. The system must display received messages on the receiver's screen within 1 second
10. The system must load messages from Firebase Firestore on app startup
11. The system must show sender identification for each message
12. The system must display message timestamps

### User Interface
13. The system must provide a clean, familiar chat interface layout
14. The system must use Tailwind CSS for styling
15. The system must display messages in a scrollable list format
16. The system must differentiate between sent and received messages visually
17. The system must auto-scroll to show the latest message

### Error Handling
18. The system must display "Server is down" error message when Firebase is unavailable
19. The system must prevent message sending when Firebase is unavailable
20. The system must provide clear feedback for failed message attempts

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

- Message editing or deletion
- Message status indicators (sent/delivered/read)
- Offline message persistence
- Group messaging
- Image or media sharing
- Push notifications
- Message search functionality
- Message reactions or emoji responses
- Advanced UI animations or transitions
- Message encryption
- Message forwarding

---

## Design Considerations

### UI/UX Requirements
- **Layout:** Standard chat interface with message list at top, input field at bottom
- **Styling:** Use Tailwind CSS for consistent, modern styling
- **Component Library:** Consider React Native Elements or NativeBase for pre-built components
- **Message Bubbles:** Differentiate sent vs received messages with left/right alignment
- **Typography:** Clear, readable font sizes for message text and timestamps

### Visual Design
- **Color Scheme:** Clean, minimal design with good contrast
- **Message Bubbles:** Rounded corners, appropriate padding
- **Input Field:** Clear text input with prominent send button
- **Loading States:** Simple loading indicators for message sending

---

## Technical Considerations

### Backend Integration
- **Firebase Firestore:** Primary database for message storage
- **Real-time Listeners:** Use `onSnapshot()` for live message updates
- **Authentication:** Firebase Auth integration required
- **Error Handling:** Comprehensive Firebase error handling

### Data Model
```typescript
interface Message {
  id: string;           // Unique message identifier
  text: string;         // Message content
  senderId: string;     // User ID of sender
  timestamp: Date;      // When message was sent
  chatId: string;       // Chat/room identifier
}
```

### Performance Considerations
- **Message Pagination:** Load last 50 messages initially
- **Real-time Updates:** Efficient Firestore listeners
- **UI Responsiveness:** Immediate local state updates for sent messages

---

## Success Metrics

### Primary Success Criteria
- **Message Delivery Speed:** Messages appear on both devices within 1 second
- **Reliability:** 99%+ message delivery success rate
- **User Experience:** Clear visual feedback for all message states
- **Authentication:** Seamless user login and session management

### Testing Criteria
- Send message from Device A → appears on Device A's screen immediately
- Send message from Device A → appears on Device B's screen within 1 second
- Message visible in Firebase Console with correct data structure
- Error handling works when Firebase is unavailable
- Multiple users can send/receive messages simultaneously

---

## Open Questions

1. **Component Library:** Should we use React Native Elements, NativeBase, or stick with custom Tailwind components?
2. **Chat ID Strategy:** How should we generate unique chat IDs for user pairs?
3. **Message Ordering:** Should messages be ordered by timestamp ascending or descending?
4. **Input Validation:** What are the minimum/maximum message length requirements?
5. **User Display:** How should we show sender names in the chat (display name vs user ID)?
6. **Error Recovery:** Should we implement automatic retry for failed messages?

## Implementation Notes

- This milestone focuses on establishing the core messaging foundation
- Keep implementation minimal to enable rapid MVP delivery
- Prioritize reliability over advanced features
- Ensure clean, maintainable code structure for future enhancements
- Test thoroughly on real devices for accurate performance measurement

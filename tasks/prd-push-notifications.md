# Push Notifications Feature PRD - MessageAI

## Feature Overview
**Feature Name:** Push Notifications  
**Priority:** High (MVP Requirement)  
**Timeline:** Phase 6 (Hours 22-24)  
**Scope:** Smart MVP - Foreground notifications with smart suppression and group support
**Implementation:** Simplest solution that functions (Option B)

---

## User Stories

### Primary User: Busy Parent/Caregiver (Sarah, 35)
**As Sarah, I want to:**
1. Receive immediate notification when I receive a message while using the app (but not in that specific chat) so I don't miss important updates
2. See who sent the message and a preview of what they said so I can prioritize my response
3. Tap the notification to instantly open the correct chat so I can respond quickly
4. Not be interrupted by notifications when I'm already reading messages in that specific chat
5. Trust that notifications work reliably so I don't miss urgent family communications

### Secondary User: Partner/Family Member (Mike, 37)
**As Mike, I want to:**
1. Know that Sarah will see my message notification even if she's using another app
2. Have confidence that urgent messages will get Sarah's attention immediately
3. Not spam Sarah with notifications when she's already actively chatting with me

## Feature Requirements

### MVP Scope: Smart Foreground Notifications (Option B)

#### Core Functionality
- **Notification Trigger:** New message received while app is open but not in the active chat
- **Notification Display:** Banner notification at top of screen with sender name and message preview
- **Notification Action:** Tap notification opens the specific chat where message was sent
- **Smart Suppression:** No notification if user is already viewing that specific chat
- **Group Chat Support:** Notifications work for both 1x1 and group chats

- **Integration:** Leverage existing `useMessages`, `usePresence`, and `MessagingService` architecture

#### Notification Content Format
```
Title: "New message from [Sender Name]"
Body: "[Message preview - first 50 chars]..."
Action: Tap to open chat
```

#### Group Chat Behavior
- **Notification Title:** "New message in [Group Name]"
- **Notification Body:** "[Sender Name]: [Message preview]"
- **Smart Grouping:** Show latest sender name for context

### Post-MVP Scope: Background Notifications (Future)

#### Background Notification Features (Not in MVP)
- **Killed App Notifications:** Notify when app is completely closed
- **Background App Notifications:** Notify when app is minimized/backgrounded
- **Notification Preferences:** User settings for notification behavior
- **Quiet Hours:** Scheduled notification suppression
- **Custom Sounds:** Different notification sounds per chat/user
- **Notification Actions:** Quick reply, mark as read from notification
- **Badge Count:** Unread message count on app icon

---

## Technical Architecture

### System Components

#### 1. Firebase Cloud Functions
```typescript
// Trigger: New message created in Firestore
exports.sendMessageNotification = functions.firestore
  .document('chats/{chatId}/messages/{messageId}')
  .onCreate(async (snap, context) => {
    // Implementation details in technical spec
  });
```

**Responsibilities:**
- Detect new message creation
- Fetch recipient's FCM token and online status
- Check if recipient is in active chat
- Build notification payload
- Send notification via FCM Admin SDK

#### 2. FCM Token Management
**Storage:** Firestore `users/{userId}` document
```typescript
interface UserDocument {
  fcmToken: string;
  lastTokenUpdate: Timestamp;
  notificationPreferences: {
    enabled: boolean;
    foregroundOnly: boolean; // MVP: always true
  };
}
```

**Token Lifecycle:**
- Register token on app launch
- Update token on auth state change
- Refresh token when expired
- Remove token on logout

#### 3. Expo Notifications Integration
**Foreground Handler:**
```typescript
Notifications.setNotificationHandler({
  handleNotification: async () => ({
    shouldShowAlert: true,
    shouldPlaySound: true,
    shouldSetBadge: false, // MVP: no badge count
  }),
});
```

**Notification Response Handler:**
- Parse notification data for chat navigation
- Navigate to specific chat screen
- Mark message as read if needed

#### 4. App State Management
**Active Chat Tracking:**
- Track currently active chat ID
- Update when user navigates between chats
- Reset when app goes to background

**App State Detection:**
- Foreground/background state changes
- Chat screen visibility
- Notification permission status

### Data Flow

```
1. User A sends message to User B
2. Message saved to Firestore
3. Cloud Function triggered (message onCreate)
4. Function checks User B's status:
   - Is User B online?
   - Is User B in active chat with User A?
   - Does User B have valid FCM token?
5. If conditions met â†’ Send FCM notification
6. User B's device receives notification
7. Expo Notifications displays banner
8. User B taps notification
9. App navigates to specific chat
10. Message marked as read (if applicable)
```

## User Experience Design

### Notification Appearance

#### iOS Notification Banner
- **Position:** Top of screen, below status bar
- **Duration:** 5 seconds auto-dismiss
- **Style:** System notification banner
- **Sound:** Default notification sound
- **Vibration:** Standard notification vibration

#### Android Notification
- **Position:** Top of screen
- **Duration:** 5 seconds auto-dismiss
- **Style:** Heads-up notification
- **Sound:** Default notification sound
- **Vibration:** Standard notification vibration

### Notification Content Examples

#### One-on-One Chat
```
Title: "New message from Mike"
Body: "Can you pick up Emma from soccer practice at 4pm?"
```

#### Group Chat
```
Title: "New message in Family Chat"
Body: "Sarah: The kids are ready for pickup!"
```

#### Long Message Preview
```
Title: "New message from School Admin"
Body: "Reminder: Parent-teacher conferences are scheduled for next week. Please check your email for your assigned time slot. If you need to reschedule, please contact..."
```

### Edge Cases & Error Handling

#### Permission Denied
- **Behavior:** Silent failure, no notification sent
- **User Feedback:** None (don't interrupt user experience)
- **Recovery:** User can enable in Settings app

#### Invalid FCM Token
- **Behavior:** Log error, attempt token refresh
- **Recovery:** Update token on next app launch
- **Fallback:** None (notification simply won't be sent)

#### Network Failure
- **Behavior:** FCM handles retry automatically
- **User Impact:** Minimal (notification may be delayed)
- **Recovery:** Automatic retry by FCM service

#### App Crashed/Force Quit
- **Behavior:** No notification (MVP limitation)
- **Future:** Background notifications will handle this
